        When comparing Git pull vs fetch, Git fetch is a safer <br>
    alternative because it pulls in all the commits from your remote <br>
    but doesn’t make any changes to your local files. On the other <br>
    hand, Git pull is faster as you’re performing multiple actions in <br>
    one – a better bang for your buck. Using the Git pull command can be <br>
    seen in one light as a feature of convenience; you’re probably less <br>
    worried about introducing conflicts into your local repo and you just <br>
    want the most up-to-date changes from the remote branch you’re pulling <br>
    from. Git pull is a more advanced action and it’s important to <br>
    understand that you will be introducing changes and immediately <br>
     applying them to your currently checked out branch.
